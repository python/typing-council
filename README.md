# Python Typing Council

## About the Typing Council

The Typing Council was created in [PEP 729](https://peps.python.org/pep-0729/) to
govern the Python type system. Its mandate is to ensure that the type system is
useful, usable, and stable.

The current members of the Council are:

* Eric Traut ([@erictraut](https://github.com/erictraut))
* Guido van Rossum ([@gvanrossum](https://github.com/gvanrossum))
* Jelle Zijlstra ([@JelleZijlstra](https://github.com/JelleZijlstra))
* Rebecca Chen ([@rchen152](https://github.com/rchen152))
* Shantanu Jain ([@hauntsaninja](https://github.com/hauntsaninja))

## Decisions

The Council makes decisions in response to issues opened on this repo. Such
decisions include:

* Substantive changes to the specification for the type system
* Recommendations on [PEPs that relate to typing](https://peps.python.org/topic/typing/)

Any such issues should first be discussed on [discuss.python.org](https://discuss.python.org/c/typing/32)
before being submitted for a decision.
